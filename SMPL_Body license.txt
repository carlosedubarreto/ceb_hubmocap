SMPL: Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (hereinafter "SMPL-Model") is a 3D representation of the human body that supports realistic changes in body shape and pose. SMPL-Body is a subset of SMPL-Model which excludes the shape blendshapes or the tools to create 3D bodies using the shape blendshapes of the SMPL-Model. A SMPL-Body contains a 3D mesh, a skeleton rig, pose blendshapes and dynamic blendshapes. A SMPL-Body can be shared in the form of OBJ file(s), animated FBX file(s), or as a set of mesh vertices, skeleton rig, pose blendshapes and dynamic blendshapes in other appropriate 3D file formats.
